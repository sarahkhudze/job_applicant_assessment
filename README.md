Overview
The job applicant assessment notebook provides a framework to process and analyze applicant data using Python. The key steps in the assessment process include:

Data Import: Applicants' data can be imported from CSV, Excel, or other formats.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Missing values are handled, and data is formatted to ensure consistency.
Scoring System: Applicants are evaluated based on predefined criteria such as experience, education, skills, and other job-specific requirements.
Ranking & Visualization: Applicants are ranked based on their scores, and key metrics are visualized for easy interpretation.
The notebook serves as a tool to automate the early stages of the recruitment process, making it easier for hiring teams to filter and prioritize candidates.
